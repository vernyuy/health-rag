# Introduction

The AWS Generative AI Constructs Library is an open-source extension of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) that provides multi-service, well-architected patterns for quickly defining solutions in code to create predictable and repeatable infrastructure, called [constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html). The goal of AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs is to help developers build generative AI solutions using pattern-based definitions for their architecture.

The patterns defined in AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs are high level, multi-service abstractions of AWS CDK constructs that have default configurations based on well-architected best practices. The library is organized into logical modules using object-oriented techniques to create each architectural pattern model.

# CDK Versions

AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs and the AWS CDK are independent teams and have different release schedules. Each release of AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs is built against a specific version of the AWS CDK. The [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file lists the CDK version associated with each AWS Generative AI Constructs release. For instance, AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs v0.0.0 was built against AWS CDK v2.96.2. This means that to use AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs v0.0.0, your application must include AWS CDK v2.96.2 or later. You can continue to use the latest AWS CDK versions and upgrade the your AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs version when new releases become available.

# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome! Check out our [contributor guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Design guidelines and Development guide

If you want to add a new construct to the library, check out our [design guidelines](./DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md), then follow the [development guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)

# Getting Started

#### For TypeScript:

* Create or use an existing CDK application in TypeScript.

  * `cdk init app --language typescript`
* Run `npm install @cdklabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs`
* The package should be added to your package.json.
* Import the library:

  * `import * as genai from '@cdklabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs';`

#### For Python:

* Create or use an existing CDK application in Python

  * `cdk init app --language python`
* Install the package:

  * `pip install cdklabs.generative-ai-cdk-constructs`
* Import the library:

  * `import cdklabs.generative_ai_cdk_constructs`

# Sample Use Cases

The official samples repository https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-cdk-constructs-samples includes a collection of functional use case implementations to demonstrate the usage of AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs. These can be used in the same way as architectural patterns, and can be conceptualized as an additional "higher-level" abstraction of those patterns. Those patterns (constructs) are composed together into [stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/stacks.html), forming a "CDK app".

# Operational Metrics Collection

Provided CDK constructs collect anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality and features of the constructs. Data collection is subject to the AWS Privacy Policy (https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). To opt out of this feature, simply disable it by setting the construct property "enableOperationalMetric" to false for each construct used. Defaults to true.

# Roadmap

Roadmap is available through the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/136)

# Legal Disclaimer

You should consider doing your own independent assessment before using the content in this library for production purposes. This may include (amongst other things) testing, securing, and optimizing the CDK constructs and other content, provided in this library, based on your specific quality control practices and standards.

        :param code: The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param application_log_level: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param log_format: Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
